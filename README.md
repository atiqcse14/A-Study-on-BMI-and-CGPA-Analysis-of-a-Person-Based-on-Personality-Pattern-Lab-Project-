# A-Study-on-BMI-and-CGPA-Analysis-of-a-Person-Based-on-Personality-Pattern-Lab-Project-
In computer science, a pattern is represented using vector featuresâ€™ values. This project is about to predict the physical condition of a person based on height, weight and BMI. And another problem is to find the high/low CGPA based on theory class attendance, theory class interest, lab interest, class note taking tendency, number of private tuition or part time activities and preference of class lectures or online tutorials. This describes some plot and helps to visualize the data in a satisfactory way.
